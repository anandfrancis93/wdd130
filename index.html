    <p style="font-size: 20px;" >Greetings, everyone! I'm Francis, hailing from the city of New Delhi, India. Currently, I'm pursuing a major in Computer Information Technology.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 20px;">I'm a passionate tech enthusiast who enjoys reading articles and videos on the latest technologies. Additionally, I love to play soccer, video games and have a keen interest in the world of timepieces, making me a watch aficionado as well.</p>

        Engaging in web design not only satisfies a major prerequisite but also empowers me creatively and professionally. This skill is a key to global connectivity in today's digital era, allowing me to reach diverse audiences worldwide. Additionally, web design opens doors to various career opportunities in our digital job market. In sum, my pursuit of web design extends beyond academic requirements; it's a gateway to creativity, global reach, and enhanced career prospects.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 20px;">I've been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints since November 2017. When it comes to favorite verses, there are so many profoundly meaningful ones that I can't pick just one.</p>
